# python-challenge-1


## Challenge 1 Objective
Design an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills I've learned in Python during weeks 1 and 2 of class, such as how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries as well as how to iterate through data structures.


## Challenge 1 Execution
Using the starter code provided for printing the menu for the customer, I adapted the menu to allow customers to place an order, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. 


## Challenge 1 Additional Notes
I used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26660654/how-do-i-print-the-key-value-pairs-of-a-dictionary-in-python) to find code for printing the key-value pairs of a dictionary, begining at line 105

I worked with my classmates in a group to complete this project. Those with prior coding experience helped those of us without coding experience understand and complete this challenge.
